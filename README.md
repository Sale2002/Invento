# Inventory Tracking 
## I. Introduction
### 1.1. About Project
Efficient inventory management is critical for ensuring smooth supply chains and meeting customer demand. This report provides an **overview of warehouse data** and offers **insights** to assist stakeholders (warehouse managers, sales, and marketing teams) in making informed decisions to **optimize operations**.
### 1.2. About Dataset
* **Introduction to Dataset:** AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer - Adventure Works Cycles. 
Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources.
* **Data Dictionary:**

### 1.3. Business Problem
The business problem for Adventure Works Cycles relates to the **management and optimization of inventory** across multiple locations to support various departments such as manufacturing, sales, and marketing. The **main challenges** include:
* **Control of inventory quantities** to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
* **Determine the accurate value of inventory** to support financial decisions.
* **Evaluate the effectiveness of current inventory management practices** to improve operational efficiency.

The goal is to provide stakeholders (warehouse managers, sales, and marketing teams) with accurate, actionable **data insights** to **streamline operations**, **improve decision-making**, and **enhance overall business performance**.
## II. Design Thinking
Here are the four steps of design thinking: [Appendix_1](appendix_1)
### Step 1: Empathize
This step involves gaining a deep understanding of the users or stakeholders' needs, motivations, and pain points. It’s all about listening and gathering insights through observations, interviews, and research.

**How to apply:**
* Speak with warehouse managers, sales teams, and marketing teams to understand their specific challenges with inventory tracking.
* Identify the frustrations they face, such as not having real-time stock information, inaccurate inventory data, or difficulty forecasting demand.

### Step 2: Define POV (Point of View)
After gathering insights, define the core problem from the users' perspective. The "Point of View" is a clear problem statement that reflects the user’s needs and the insights gathered in the empathize phase.

**How to apply:**
* Synthesize the information collected and create a problem statement such as: "Warehouse managers need a real-time inventory tracking system because they currently lack accurate data, which leads to stockouts and delays in fulfilling customer orders."
### Step 3: Ideate
In this phase, brainstorm as many ideas and potential solutions as possible without restrictions. The goal is to explore various approaches to solving the problem identified in the previous step.

**How to apply:**
* Facilitate a brainstorming session with your team to generate creative ideas for solving the inventory tracking issues, such as:
* Automating real-time inventory updates across multiple locations.
* Developing a centralized dashboard for all stakeholders (warehouse, sales, marketing) to access inventory data.
* Using predictive analytics to forecast demand and stock requirements.
### Step 4: Prototype and Review
Now, take the most promising ideas from the ideation phase and create a prototype—a scaled-down version of the solution that can be tested. After building the prototype, gather feedback from stakeholders and iterate on the solution.

**How to apply:**
* Build a prototype of the real-time inventory tracking system or dashboard.
* Present it to warehouse managers and the sales/marketing teams to get their feedback.
* Use the feedback to make improvements, refine the interface, or enhance functionality.

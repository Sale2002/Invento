# Inventory Tracking 
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management for Adventure Works Cycles by leveraging data from the AdventureWorks database. The goal was to address critical challenges such as overstocking, stockouts, inaccurate valuation, and inefficiencies in current practices.

Using the Design Thinking framework, we engaged stakeholders (warehouse managers, sales, and marketing teams) to identify pain points, define core problems, and ideate solutions. A prototype of a real-time inventory tracking dashboard was developed, enabling centralized access to stock levels, product value, and key performance metrics across multiple warehouses.

The dashboard provided actionable insights through:

Inventory overview to monitor stock levels and availability.

Product value analysis to support accurate financial decision-making.

Inventory metrics analysis to evaluate operational efficiency.

Recommendations included automating real-time inventory updates, integrating predictive analytics for demand forecasting, and refining reporting for cross-departmental decision-making.

Overall, the project demonstrated how data-driven solutions can reduce stock imbalances, improve financial accuracy, and enhance supply chain performance.

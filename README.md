The Inventory Tracking Project focused on solving key challenges in warehouse operations, including overstocking, stockouts, and inaccurate inventory valuation. By applying the Design Thinking framework, the project engaged stakeholders across warehouse, sales, and marketing teams to identify pain points and define clear problem statements.

A real-time inventory tracking dashboard was developed to provide centralized access to stock levels, product value, and operational metrics. This solution delivered data-driven insights that improved financial accuracy, streamlined reporting, and enhanced supply chain performance.

Key recommendations included automating real-time updates and integrating predictive analytics for demand forecasting, ensuring inventory decisions are both timely and reliable. The project ultimately demonstrated how data-driven solutions can reduce risk, optimize efficiency, and support better financial decision-making.
